<h3>API Testing (Optional)</h3>

You can also test using Postman or cURL. But before doing this, you must polpulate your User table with some data.

Example request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/notifications/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": 1,
    "message": "Hello from the Notification System!",
    "channel": "email"
  }'
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/notifications/send-bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "position": "Developer",
    "message": "Test notification message",
    "channels": ["email"]
  }'
```


<h3>Design Pattern Used</h3>

The project follows:

- Dependency Injection for cleaner controller logic.
- Strategy Pattern to choose the notification strategy.



<h3>Sending Notification Automatically</h3>
- Firstly you need to download and install rabbitmq. Also you have to update the .env file like the below

```bash
QUEUE_CONNECTION=rabbitmq

RABBITMQ_HOST=127.0.0.1
RABBITMQ_PORT=5672
RABBITMQ_USER=admin
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=admin123
RABBITMQ_VHOST=/
RABBITMQ_QUEUE=notifications
```

- After that you need to start the rabbitmq server.
- After this open a new terminal and run

```bash
php artisan queue:work rabbitmq --queue=notifications --tries=3 --sleep=3 -vvv
```

- In another terminal
```bash
php artisan schedule:work
```
